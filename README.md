***Libraries importants*** on the script :
 - *array         (create by script)*
 - *type_repr (create by script)*
 - *strerror     (create by script)*
 - *paramiko  (most important)*

# How it work
You only need push IP's on the file ***ips.txt*** and then write the command you need and press **Enter**, happy hack!
***Note important ! :*** verify that your command produces output that the script can capture
